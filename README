django-tracking is a simple attempt at keeping track of visitors to Django-powered Web sites.  It also offers basic blacklisting capabilities.

==Features==

  * Tracks the following information about your visitors:
    * Session key
    * IP address
    * User agent
    * Whether or not they are a registered user and logged in
    * Where they came from (http-referer)
    * What page on your site they last visited
    * How many pages on your site they have visited
  * Allows user-agent filtering for visitor tracking
  * Automatic clean-up of old visitor records
  * Can ban certain IP addresses, rendering the site useless to visitors from those IP's (great for stopping spam)
  * The ability to have a live feed of active users on your website
  * Template tags to:
    * display how many active users there are on your site
    * determine how many active users are on the same page within your site
  * Optional "Active Visitors Map" to see where visitors are in the world

==Requirements==

As far as I am aware, the only requirement for django-tracking to work is a modern version of Django.  I developed the project on Django 1.0 alpha 2 and beta 1 (currently on revision 8375).  It is designed to work with the newforms-admin functionality.

If you wish to use a Google Map to display where your visitors are probably at, you must have a Google Maps API key, which is free (http://code.google.com/intl/ro/apis/maps/signup.html).  Along with that, you must have the GeoIP C API installed (http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/api/c/GeoIP.tar.gz) and the GeoIP Python API (http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/api/python/GeoIP-Python-1.2.4.tar.gz).  Finally, you might want to grab the GeoLite City binary unless you are a paying MaxMind customer.  Configuring this feature is discussed later.

==Installation==

Download `django-tracking` using *one* of the following methods:

===easy_install===

You can download the package from the [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-tracking/ CheeseShop] or use

{{{
easy_install django-tracking
}}}

to download and install `django-tracking`.

===Checkout from Subversion===

{{{
svn co http://django-tracking.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ django-tracking
}}}

===Package Download===

Download the latest `.tar.gz` file from the downloads section and extract it somewhere you'll remember.

The `setup.py` script for this project doesn't seem to install the templates associated with `django-tracking` (at least on my wife's Mac), but I am working to figure out why.

==Configuration==

First of all, you must add this project to your list of `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`:

{{{
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.sites',
    ...
    'tracking',
    ...
)
}}}

Run `manage.py syncdb`.  This creates a few tables in your database that are necessary for operation.

Depending on how you wish to use this application, you have a few options:

===Visitor Tracking===

Add `tracking.middleware.VisitorTrackingMiddleware` to your `MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES` in `settings.py`.

====Automatic Visitor Clean-Up====

If you want to have Django automatically clean past visitor information out your database, put `tracking.middleware.VisitorCleanUpMiddleware`in your `MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`.

===IP Banning===

Add `tracking.middleware.BannedIPMiddleware` to your `MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES` in `settings.py`.  I would recommend making this the very first item in `MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES` so your banned users do not have to drill through any other middleware before Django realizes they don't belong on your site.

===Visitors on Page (template tag)===

Make sure that `django.core.context_processors.request` is somewhere in your `TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS` tuple.  This context processor makes the `request` object accessible to your templates.  This application uses the `request` object to determine what page the user is looking at in a template tag.

==Active Visitors Map==

If you're interested in seeing where your visitors are at a given point in time, you might enjoy the active visitor map feature.  Be sure you have added a line to your main URLconf, as follows:

{{{
from django.conf.urls.defaults import *

urlpatterns = patterns('',
    ....
    (r'^tracking/', include('tracking.urls')),
    ....
)
}}}

Next, set a couple of settings in your `settings.py`:

 * `GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY`: Your very own Google Maps API key
 * `TRACKING_USE_GEOIP`: set this to `True` if you want to see markers on the map
 * `GEOIP_DATA_FILE`: set this to the absolute path on the filesystem of your `GeoIP.dat` or `GeoIPCity.dat` or whatever file.  It's usually something like `/usr/local/share/GeoIP.dat` or `/usr/share/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat`.  You can try leaving this blank if you want; the code will look in the default location if possible.

When that's done, you should be able to go to `/tracking/map/` on your site (replacing `tracking` with whatever prefix you chose to use in your URLconf, obviously).  The default template relies upon jQuery for its awesomeness, but you're free to use whatever you would like.

==Usage==

To display the number of active users there are in one of your templates, make sure you have `{% load tracking_tags %}` somewhere in your template and do something like this:

{{{
{% visitors_on_site as visitors %}
<p>
    {{ visitors }} active user{{ visitors|pluralize }}
</p>
}}}

If you also want to show how many people are looking at the same page:

{{{
{% visitors_on_page as same_page %}
<p>
    {{ same_page }} of {{ visitors }} active user{{ visitors|pluralize }}
    {% ifequal same_page 1 %}is{% else %}are{% endifequal %} reading this page
</p>
}}}

If you don't want particular areas of your site to be tracked, you may define a list of prefixes in your `settings.py` using the `NO_TRACKING_PREFIXES`.  For example, if you didn't want visits to the `/family/` section of your website, set `NO_TRACKING_PREFIXES` to `['/family/']`.

If you don't want to count certain user-agents, such as Yahoo!'s Slurp and Google's Googlebot, you may add keywords to your visitor tracking in your Django administration interface.  Look for "Untracked User-Agents" and add a keyword that distinguishes a particular user-agent.  Any visitors with the keyword in their user-agent string will not be tracked.

By default, active users include any visitors within the last 10 minutes.  If you would like to override that setting, just set `TRACKING_TIMEOUT` to however many minutes you want in your `settings.py`.

For automatic visitor clean-up, any records older than 24 hours are removed by default.  If you would like to override that setting, set `TRACKING_CLEANUP_TIMEOUT` to however many hours you want in your `settings.py`.

Good luck!  Please contact me with any questions or concerns you have with the project!
